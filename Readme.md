# Advanced OOP & Collections HW

# Circle example:
Create a class called circle. It contains:

* Two private instance variables: radius (of type double) and color (of type String), with default value of 1.0 and "red", respectively.
* Two public methods: getRadius() and getArea().
* Declare an instance of class Circle in the main and test methods(getRadius, getArea) of this instance.


Create a subclass called Cylinder derived from the superclass Circle. It:
* Inherits the variables and methods from the superclass Circle.
* One private instance variables: height (of type double) with default value of 1.0 and "red", respectively.
* Two public methods: getHeight() and getVolume().
* Declare an instance of class Cylinder in the main and test its methods. 


# Collections 

* Write a Java program to replace the second element of a ArrayList with the specified element

* Create a new priority queue, add some colors (string) and iterate through all elements.

* Let the user insert elements into priority queue then check if a specific element is in the list or not.
